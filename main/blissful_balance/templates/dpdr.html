        <header class="text-center font-extrabold text-3xl mt-1">What is DPDR?</header>
        <p class="w-3/5 text-center py-3 mt-3 text-lg">
          Depersonalization-Derealization disorder is a mental health condition that affects an individual’s sense of self and surroundings. 
          People with DPDR may feel detached from their thoughts, feelings, and body and may also experience a sense of unreality or 
          detachment from their surroundings. The exact causes of DPDR are not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to its development. 
          Some of these factors include stress, trauma, severe anxiety disorders, and substance use. Depersonalization and Derealization are 
          slightly different but are still considered to be one condition. Let’s see what the differences are.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img class="w-20" src="{% static 'images/exited_brain.jpeg' %}" alt="Description">
      <p class="w-3/5 text-center py-3 mt-3 text-lg">
        <span class="text-purple-500">Depersonalization</span> is when you feel detached or disconnected from your thoughts, feelings, emotions, senses, and body. 
        You may feel as if you are observing yourself from a distance or as if your body is not your own.
      </p>
      <p class="w-3/5 text-center py-3 mt-3 text-lg">
        <span class="text-purple-500">Derealization</span> is when you feel detached or disconnected from your environment. The world might look weird, 2D-shaped, and distorted. 
        It may feel like the world around you is fake and that people around you are also not real.
      </p>
      <p class="w-3/5 text-center py-3 mt-3 text-lg">
        Although the two have some differences, we will treat both as one disorder. It does not matter if you might have 
        derealization over depersonalization or vice versa. It does not matter if you have both since recovery is the same.

            If you answered yes to all or most of these, then you might be dealing with DPDR. Reminder:

          If you don't suffer from OCD or Depersonalization Derealization Disorder(DPDR), staying away from those channels is recommended. 
          Reading up on it will not be beneficial for non-sufferers. OCD is characterized by extremely disturbing thoughts and mental or 
          physical compulsions. DPDR is characterized by an extreme disconnection from oneself. Please take note before entering in those channels.

            NO! DPDR might have some of the scariest symptoms out of other anxiety disorders, 
            but you can make a full 100% recovery! It does not matter if your DPDR was caused by 
            stress, trauma, severe anxiety disorder, or drugs; recovery is generally the same for 
            all of these causes, as long as we address any underlying factors.

            DPDR is a response caused by your fight or flight system. You have not messed up
